# Risk Assessment Analysis: Analyzing loan portfolio Risk for Daiz Bank

In this project, I helped Daiz Bank to tackle its challenge of managing its vast and diverse loan portfolio. This portfolio is not just a cornerstone of the bank's success but also a critical component in safeguarding the financial well-being of countless clients.

🔍 𝐃𝐚𝐢𝐳 𝐁𝐚𝐧𝐤'𝐬 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦:
Daiz Bank faces a significant challenge in effectively assessing and mitigating the multifaceted risks associated with its loan portfolio. Traditional risk assessment approaches have become increasingly inefficient in today’s fast-paced economic landscape. There is an urgent need for a dynamic, data-driven approach to risk assessment that not only identifies risks but also proactively mitigates them in real time.

💡 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:
Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard to provide Daiz Bank with a comprehensive and insightful view of their customers' loan portfolios, types, and statuses. This powerful tool aids in visualizing critical data points, helping the bank to make informed decisions swiftly.

📊 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:
- Repayment Health: While a repayment rate of 61.81% might seem healthy, a delinquency rate of 21% and a default rate of 17.21% indicate significant risk.
- The highest loan amount and interest were recorded in 2019, with mortgages being the most borrowed product.
- The age group of 35-41 accounted for the highest sum loan amount.
- Commercial loans had the highest rate of default in 2018 and 2019, while mortgages led in 2020 and 2021.

💡 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
1. Enhanced Credit Scoring
2. Targeted Risk Management for Loan Types
3. Age Group Analysis
4. Product Focus
5. Early Delinquency and Default Intervention
6. Reviewing Interest Rate Policies
7. Loan Performance Monitoring
8. Financial Education

These insights and recommendations aim to help Daiz Bank mitigate risks and ensure the financial well-being of its clients.
